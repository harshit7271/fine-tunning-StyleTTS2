1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
step in this learning formula is practice. The well-known Sanskrit saying

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,720
karat karat abhyas ke, jad mati hot sujan translates to practice makes perfect

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,720
emphasizing that repeated practice leads to mastery. The best way to practice is

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,780
by solving past year papers and take mock tests. These tools helps you

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,900
identify mistakes you might make on the exam day. It is better to make the learn

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,940
from mistakes in a mock test than to make them during the actual exam.

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,420
Practicing this way helps you spot silly mistakes and understand how to manage

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,940
your time efficiently under exam conditions.

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,440
Moving ahead, just like pre-votes exam prepare you for final exam by

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,120
highlighting errors to avoid. Regular practice is essential for mastering what

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,440
you have learned. Do not just take mock test, analyze your mistakes

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,400
and note them down in a separate notebook. This way you can review and

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,400
avoid these mistakes before exams. Now quiz station, every chapter includes

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,680
quiz stations with practice questions. These help you test to

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,680
understand the concepts right after you study a topic.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Now I will read the acknowledgment.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:50,320
I begin by bowing down to the mighty Lord Ganesh, the revered

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,800
Vighna Harta. His divine grace has endured the smooth complexion of this

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,440
book, clearing all obstacles from my path. I bow down to Mahasaraswati, to my

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,520
ancestors and special thanks to my family. The creation of this book is the

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,920
result of many people standing by my side, helping, motivating and guiding me.

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,320
Their unwavering support and encouragement have been instrumental in

23
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:25,360
bringing this work to life. I am deeply grateful to Shri Sardar Girdhar

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:38,520
ji, late Shri Ram ji. One of the most rewarding career

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,480
opportunities after clearing the UGC net exam is becoming an assistant

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,200
professor in colleges and universities. The table below highlights the pay scale

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,320
structure for various academic positions, showcasing the financial benefits of

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,240
pursuing this career path. In the academic pay scale, the table given on the left

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,640
side, the level indicates the hierarchical position of a faculty member in college

30
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,040
and universities. This level is determined based on a combination of

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,720
factors including years of experience, academic qualification and the number of

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
research papers published. When an individual clears UGC net, they become

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,600
eligible for the position of assistant professor, starting typically at the

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,200
level 10. With consistent performance, research, contribution and experience,

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,040
they can progress to higher levels. In the addition of basic salary given in

36
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,560
the table above, academic professionals are entitled to HRA that is house rent

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,560
allowance, TA that is travel allowance and GP that is grade pay which enhance

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,920
their overall compensation. This financial stability combined with the

39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,720
prestige of teaching makes academia a higher attractive

40
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,720
career option post UGC net.

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,520
Eligibility in the case of special degree certificate programs. If you have

42
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,680
a postgraduate diploma or certificate from an Indian or foreign university, you

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,480
need to check if it's equivalent to the master's degree from a recognized

44
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,600
university. For this, contact the Association of Indian Universities, AIU

45
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,200
in New Delhi. Law students should check with the Bar Council of India. Candidates

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:44,360
with a four-year or eight-year semester batch bachelor degrees need at least

47
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,640
75 marks, 75% marks or equivalent grade. There is a 5% relaxation for the Dalits.

48
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,280
Net eligibility. If you qualify for the net with a four-year bachelor's degree,

49
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,720
you are eligible for the junior research fellowship that is JRF and PhD admission

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,080
but not for appointment as an assistant professor. Final year students

51
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,480
for a four-year bachelor degree.

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:26,640
Candidates should select their UGC net paper to subject based on their postgraduate

53
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,840
specialization. For example, a student with an MA in political science should

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,320
choose political science as their paper to subject. If a candidate's postgraduate

55
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,400
degree is in subject not listed by the UGC, they may choose a closely related

56
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,240
subject from the available option.

57
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,120
Study timetable for covering UGC net paper 1 syllabus in just 33 days.

58
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,480
In this book, the 10 units of the UGC net paper 1 syllabus have been meticulously

59
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,040
divided into 33 chapters. This structured approach allows you to focus on

60
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,720
completing one chapter per day enabling you to finish the entire syllabus in

61
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,600
just 33 days. The reason behind this approach is to prevent students from

62
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,320
feeling overwhelmed by a single large unit. By breaking down the syllabus into

63
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,520
smaller manageable chapters, we help you cover the material gradually and

64
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,240
systematically reducing stress and making the study process more manageable.

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,960
This method ensures a study progression through the syllabus which maintaining a sense of

66
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
accomplishment as you complete each chapter.

67
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,040
Creating a unit-wise timetable and alternative method involves creating a well-structured

68
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,040
unit-wise timetable. This approach is beneficial for those who prefer a balanced

69
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,280
study schedule that accommodates both challenging and easier topics. Here is a

70
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:09,160
simple timetable that you may find relatable and help you cover the syllabus

71
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,640
efficiently.

72
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,640
To prevent fatigue and maintain motivation, alternate between challenging and easier units.

73
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,240
For instance, pair units like teaching aptitude generally easier with research aptitude that is more

74
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,200
challenging. The method helps you keep study session balanced and less

75
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,360
overwhelming. Units that require heavy memorization such as ICT, people and

76
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,000
environment and higher education can be mentally exhausting. Mix this with

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,440
practical portions like data interpretation and mathematical reasoning

78
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,000
to give your brain a break and enhance retention. This strategy helps manage

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,960
cognitive load and improves overall learning efficiency. Allocate extra time

80
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,600
each day to practice questions from practical units such as mathematical

81
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,280
reasoning and data interpretation. Adding 30 minutes of practice will help you build

82
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,880
proficiency and improve problem solving. Since every student has unique strength

83
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,520
and weakness, you might find certain topics easier or more challenging than

84
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,200
others. Use the tips shared above to design a timetable that suits your

85
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,680
specific need. Adjust the sample timetable based on your comfort level

86
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,320
with different units and progress to create a study plan that works best for

87
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,040
you. After designing a full syllabus timetable, it is equally

88
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:50,560
important to design a study schedule. Study schedule will help you meet your

89
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,240
targets regularly and achieve the overall goals of finishing the syllabus.

90
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,680
To complete the next paper 1 syllabus in approximately 30 days, it is advisable

91
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,720
to devote at least 4 hours daily to preparation. Here is a recommendation

92
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,320
breakdown of your daily study time. If traditional timetable haven't worked for

93
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,840
you, here is an alternate approach. To plan your net preparation, instead of

94
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,920
focusing on unit wise study plan, adopt a topic wise approach using this three

95
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,120
step formula. The foundation of an efficient timetable is understanding how

96
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,400
many days you have before the exam. For example, if you have 100 days left, this

97
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,960
clarity will help in distributing topics evenly and avoiding last minute

98
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,720
cramming. Instead of seeing the syllabus as large, overwhelming units, break it

99
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,000
down into simpler, smaller and specific topics. Count how many topics you need to

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
cover from all the 10 units. For example, instead of just thinking about R.A.

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:09,840
that is research aptitude, as a whole list out quality qualitative research,

102
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,120
sampling and hypothesis testing, this book also uses the same approach by

103
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,360
dividing each unit into individual topics. You can easily find a comprehensive

104
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,920
list of all the topics in the timetable, which shows what all the topics that you

105
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:36,080
need to study under each unit. Percentage, the type of question I will get in the

106
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,120
paper 1, I am discussing that right now. Percentage, 50% question that you see in

107
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,600
exam falls into this category of easy questioning, means 50% of the

108
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:57,400
students can easily, 50% of students nain, the paper like have 100 questions, then 50 of them are easy.

109
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,880
Strategies to solve, do not feel obligated to solve the exam paper in the order the

110
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,280
question are presented. Instead start by answering all the easy questions first.

111
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,120
This will give you a stance of accomplishment and boost your confidence

112
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,000
when you will feel that you have solved many questions correctly. Additionally,

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,800
it is important not to note that when we solve easy questions towards the end,

114
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,280
we often make errors due to time pressure. We might misread or misinterpret the question

115
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,120
or harshly choose an option. Therefore, it is advisable to tackle easy questions

116
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,000
from first when you have ample time to read and answer the question carefully.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,040
30 of them, 30% of them are false, falls into the category of difficult level questioning.

118
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,800
This, these question requires more efforts and critical thinking. You may need to apply

119
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,200
your knowledge, analysis and concept and sometimes make educated guesses to arrive

120
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,880
at the correct answer. To solve these kind of questions, apply the principle of elimination

121
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,320
by first identifying and discarding the option that you know are definitely incorrect.

122
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,600
This method simplifies complex questions and improve your chances of selecting right answers.

123
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:23,160
20% of the exams falls under the category of challenging questions. These questions

124
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,200
require more efforts and critical thinking. You may need to apply more knowledge,

125
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,960
analyze the concept and sometimes make educated guesses to arrive at the correct answers.

126
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:47,040
Feeling anxiety or anxious before an exam is completely normal, you are not alone in this

127
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,240
feeling with this way. Every UGC net and students across the country is dealing with similar feeling

128
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:03,040
stress. Remember the mountain you add that says, meaning fear is something everyone experiences.

129
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,840
Even the most accomplished individual. But what you do when anxiety strikes in the middle of the

130
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,480
exam, here's the quick mantra to regain focus and calm your nerves. Deep breathing, stay hydrated,

131
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,000
do not panic, do not panic if you forget. Do not calculate your marks during the exam.

132
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,280
Read question twice, answer all questions, use bilingual reading. Prioritize accuracy over speed,

133
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,600
avoid mental calculation to prevent errors, avoid doing calculation in your head. Use rough paper

134
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:51,520
for data interpretation and mathematical reasoning questions. Now the syllabus is,

135
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,480
unit 1 is teaching aptitude, unit 2 research aptitude, unit 3 comprehension followed by

136
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,760
communication, mathematical reasoning and aptitude, logical reasoning, data interpretation,

137
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:10,120
information communication technology that is ICT, people development and environment and last,

138
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,800
higher education system. The official net syllabus serves as a broad guideline that

139
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:24,280
does not include every topic that may appear in the exam. While it outlines key subject

140
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,480
areas under the 10 unit, the actual question often cover additional concept and topic not

141
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,080
explicitly mentioned in the syllabus. To bridge this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive

142
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:47,080
analysis of previous year's questions that is from 2014 to 2025. Based on this analysis,

143
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:55,800
we have compiled an extensive list of topics that are asked in previous papers. Now,

144
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:04,600
I should shut myself off because I am continuously speaking for 15 minutes right now. This may help

145
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,640
you. Okay. Garima Singh, over and out.
